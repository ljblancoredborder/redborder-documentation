# Reviewing remote information from Untangle

Redborder has the capability to collect information from other manufacturers and use it to monitorize remote systems. In this use case we will show how is possible to review a remote system status which is being monitorized by Untangle.

First of all we will access to Vault module.

We will select Class metric from Untangle and will filter one of them.

Once we have filtered the Class, we will see the Hostname metric which are using the filtered class.

We want to know which protocol is being used by the hostname and the class filtered.

Using the filter tool we can see that the protocol used by that particular hostname and that particular class is UDP.
